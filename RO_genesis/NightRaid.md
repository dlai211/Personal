# Full Analysis on NightRaid guild

NightRaid guild consists of approximately 50 active members, led by the Guild Master, Miirim, a mastersmith. The guild has been able to maintain consistent participation in guild events, which is commendable. However, one notable weakness of the NightRaid guild is the lack of strong players.

The presence of several alt accounts where their main is part of major guilds, such as MrWet, aaaasunnnnn, Miikosaur, and Merciless, may also be a contributing factor to the limited number of strong players in NightRaid. While having alt accounts is a common practice in the game, it can impact the overall strength of a guild.

That said, NightRaid does have some active and strong players, such as curry, cowslap, 20oz, and Miirim. These players are assets to the guild and can help in achieving guild objectives. There are also less active but strong players like Minkk, aaaasunnnn, and MrWet, who may not be as present in guild activities but can still contribute positively to the guild.

In terms of strategy and tactics, the NightRaid guild may need to focus on recruiting more strong players to balance out their current roster. They could also consider forming alliances or partnerships with other guilds to achieve common goals. 

One potential solution would be to facilitate a mutual merger between SectorSeven, Unholy, and NightRaid, which could effectively provide additional support to average guild members amidst the new challenging events, such as Hell Helheim, Nightmare Temple, and Juperos Ruin, while still accommodating new recruits with simpler daily and weekly events, including dailies, HHH, Endless Tower, and Extreme Challenge. With a merged guild, the collective entity would stand to potentially surpass the current levels of Lofi and DemonCats, thereby increasing the chances of securing a temple in the War of Emperium. By merging, NightRaid could also take advantage of Unholy's level 5 facilities and potentially increase the number of guild members making weekly contributions of 500 or more, thus raising the guild's ranking to an A or S level.

Overall, NightRaid is a relatively small guild with some strengths and weaknesses. While they may face some challenges due to their size and lack of strong players, the guild's consistency in event participation and leadership by Miirim is a good foundation to build upon.
