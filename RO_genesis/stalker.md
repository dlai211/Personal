Overall, the AA build is the most popular and versatile, with the ability to deal damage and cause abnormal status in PvP. The backstab build is ideal for boss hunting or dealing massive damage to a single target, but consumes a lot of mana potions and is not effective against high CDEF players. The penetrating shot build is useful for grinding and reducing enemy damage reduction but lacks the damage output for PvP.
