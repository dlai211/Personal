# Trapper Guide (self-made & currently in development)

## Traps Property 

## Gears
 - Highly recommend NOT to touch trap build until lvl 95 due to its low dps in low lvl.
 - For **Gears**, go for
   - `Sprint Set` (Max HP+7%, Max SP+7%, Global Cooldown-15%, MATK DMG+10%)
   - OR `Magic Master Set` (increase Skill SP cost by 10%, increase its damage based on Max SP, cannot be more than 30%)
 - For **Weapons**, go for 
   - at least +10 refinement, `Goddess of Wisdom`
 - For Cards, go for (check [awaking](https://github.com/dlai211/Personal/blob/Genesis/RO_genesis/Card%20Awaking.md) for their 3 stars attributes)

### 1. Traps can be moved by knocked-back skills, such as...
`Magnum Break`

`Arrow Shower`

### 2. Heal Traps and other Traps
#### Heal Traps
 - For `Heal traps`, they need `MATK` to increase the heal amount. 
 - No limitation for number of traps, BUT 30 seconds cooldown. So, one can spam 20-30 of them around depends on your trap cooldown time.

 - For `Damage-Dealing traps`, like Blast Mine, they require `Magic Damage (MDMG)` attribute, **NOT Magic Attack (MATK)**. Therefore, 1000 MATK deals the same trap damage as 2000 MATK. 
 - **Only** allow 3 Traps of same type exist. When exceeding 3, the game will automatically **remove** the first trap you placed.

### 3. Auto-Lock
 - All Traps auto-lock to enemy targets, including heal traps. (no comments)

### 4. Entity
 - Traps are entity, meaning that they can interact with NPC, like healing 'that dead guy' on the ground when doing North Mutant Forest (Sage 1), 
   - & take damage, here is an example where they block purple orbs in pyramid.

## Grinding
 - To maximize the efficiency of farming: require **3** mods spawn areas & focus on **elements** & **race** for bonus damage.
