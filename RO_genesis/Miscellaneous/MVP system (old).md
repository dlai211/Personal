# MVP Point System (Note: this MVP system is no longer applicable to current RO)
## Introduction
Did you ever wonder why is it that you lost the MVP kill to another team party when you were so sure about getting it? Here I am explaining how the MVP Point System works and why it is almost impossible to beat other team parties in MVP solo.

## The Point/Rank System
Many players may think the more damage/heal/etc. you do the more points you will get added. But actually that is not the case!

Instead you get ranked in different activities and according to your rank of each activity you are getting the points. In addition you have bonuses and penalties on the way.

The following table shows you the ranking with its points:

Ranking beyond the rank 10 will give you the same points as Rank 10.
Bonus
First hit: 10 points
Last hit: 20 points
Penalty
Each death reduces the personal total points by 10%.
10 deaths reduces your personal score by 100% which means all your points get erased = 0 points.

## MVP Point Calculation
All the points of every party member in your team with their bonus and penalties get summarised.

## RNG
Of course there has to be some RNG...
If the difference of total score from 2nd~3rd team to the 1st team is in the range of 25 points then the RNG kicks in with the odds among these teams.

## MINI
Some of you might wonder how it works with MINIS. 
That is very simple: The first hit wins (unless it resets then you gotta land the first hit again).

## Examples for better understanding
### Personal score
Let's say you make the highest damage amongst all the participants then you get ranked to Top 1 at Damage inflicted which gives you 30 points. The player with second highest inflicting damage will get 27 points and so on. If you do heal in addition you get ranked there as well and get additional points according to your ranking.
#### RNG
Example of the 2nd and 3rd team being in the range of 25 points to the first team and their chance to win the MVP

#### Solo

If you go Solo on MVP you obviously get ranked at the top. So first/last hit 30 points, dmg inflicted 30, healing 10 and other top points 30, that is about 100 points. 
Any time a full party can appear and they just need to tap the MVP once to instantly land in the ranking after you: DMG inflicted 27+24+21+18+15 and other activities up to (9+8+7+6+5)x4. 
I don't need to summarise the points of that one team to tell you that this is way beyond your 100 points in soloing.
#### Reset
In case the MVP resets then all the points of all participants do also reset.
