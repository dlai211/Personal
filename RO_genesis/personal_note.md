# Notes:

## Guild Build Strategy
### Step 1: Recruit New Players
#### Problem: **few number of players** out of 110 available spots in the Genesis guild
- Recruiting players **regardless of their levels or jobs** is the priority to significantly increase the guild fund. New players and return players have a decent probability of being a no-guild players. They are the **primary target** for Step 1â€™s plan.
- It requires privately messaging them to formally send invitations to the guild, **NOT randomly** click the "invite to guild" button when no-guild players walk by. **Only those** who reply to the message and show interest or affirmation to the invite, indicating a potentially active guild member, allow in the Genesis guild.
- As the size of the Genesis guild grows, it is expected for the name Genesis to show up more frequently in the joining guild list, resulting in more players (mostly new and returning) joining the Genesis guild due to the game mechanism. (my data supports this assumption).
- P.S. Since approximately half of the new players are testing the game out or for other reasons, they will be inactive in a week. It **requires higher guild position** players to spot out those players and make the tough decision as the available seats in the guild are approaching the capacity limit. 

### Step 2: Combining the Guild
#### Problem: valuable and strong guild members is less than 1/3 in Genesis Guild
- Definition in terms of RO:
  - valid guild members: 
    - Active Genesis Guild Members who need to be online once every 2 days except for specific reasons. 
    - Contribute at least 100,000 Guild Fund  (10 Hearts of Guild) in a week. 
    - Not an alt account from other guilds.
  - valuable guild members: 
    - Must be a valid guild member. 
    - At least LVL 70 players with at least 1 purple gear in the weapon or armor slots. 
    - Actively participating in time-space events, guild banquets, or guild hunt weekly. 
    - English speaker, and can send messages when in the party. 
  - strong guild members:
    - Must be valuable guild members, 
    - At least lvl 85 players with purple gears in all 4 weapon and armor slots.
    - Contribute at least 500,000 Guild Fund weekly. 
    - A support and guide for new join guild members.
