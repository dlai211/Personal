# Notes:

## Guild Build Strategy
### Step 1: Recruit New Players
#### Problem: **few number of players** out of 110 available spots in the Genesis guild
- Recruiting players **regardless of their levels or jobs** is the priority to significantly increase the guild fund. New players and return players have a decent probability of being a no-guild players. They are the **primary target** for Step 1’s plan.
- It requires privately messaging them to formally send invitations to the guild, **NOT randomly** click the "invite to guild" button when no-guild players walk by. **Only those** who reply to the message and show interest or affirmation to the invite, indicating a potentially active guild member, allow in the Genesis guild.
- As the size of the Genesis guild grows, it is expected for the name Genesis to show up more frequently in the joining guild list, resulting in more players (mostly new and returning) joining the Genesis guild due to the game mechanism. (my data supports this assumption).
- P.S. Since approximately half of the new players are testing the game out or for other reasons, they will be inactive in a week. It **requires higher guild position** players to spot out those players and make the tough decision as the available seats in the guild are approaching the capacity limit. 

### Step 2: Combining the Guilds
#### Problem: valuable and strong guild members is less than 1/3 in Genesis Guild
- Definition in terms of RO:
  - valid guild members: 
    - Active Genesis Guild Members who need to be online once every 2 days except for specific reasons. 
    - Contribute at least 100,000 Guild Fund  (10 Hearts of Guild) in a week. 
    - Not an alt account/a spy from other guilds.
  - valuable guild members: 
    - Must be a valid guild member. 
    - At least LVL 70 players with at least 1 purple gear in the weapon or armor slots. 
    - Actively participating in time-space events, guild banquets, or guild hunt weekly. 
    - English speaker, and can send messages when in the party. 
  - strong guild members:
    - Must be valuable guild members, 
    - At least lvl 85 players with purple gears in all 4 weapon and armor slots.
    - Contribute at least 500,000 Guild Fund weekly. 
    - A support and guide for new join guild members.
- A guild member leaves Genesis Guild so that one can further investigate details about other guilds - such as the current level of the guild, the number of strong and valuable players, communication, etc - in an attempt to combine two guilds together. 
- We are looking for a stagnant or dead group, where the guild has around or less than 20 members, and the guild master and vice guild masters are strong players. We can invite the entire guild to join Genesis. 
- For the preparation, the guild fund needs to close to LVL 3 guild so that we have the leverage to bargain. Genesis guild needs to have at least 20 available spots for them to join.


## Genesis Guild
- **Goal: create balance and stability to make a communal contribution.**
### Why Join?
 - More efficiently form a party to support or even carry out the mission with familiar people, like friends or guild members.
 - More material benefits, such as guild vending machine, guild auction, or simply gathering weekly benefits.
 - Randomly clicked and joined Genesis due to our auto-accepting options.
### Why Leave?
 - Receive an invitation from a better guild.
 - The current guild does NOT match their expectations.
 - Quit the game, eventually booted for being inactive.
#### Thus, the guild should become a strong, healthy, communicative, and supportive community to make guild members worth staying.
### Topic about casual players
 - Must control the portion of casual players in the guild.
 - A guild with all casual players will cease to advance since they don’t have a tendency towards a goal but rather go with the flow AND have a higher probability 
leave the guild or the game anytime, creating instability in the guild community.
 - Must respect their decisions for not over socializing. 
#### We currently have a large base of casual players, which eventually leads to three outcomes. (look 1st and 2nd outcome if we don't change anything)
 - 1st outcome (high probability): new players gradually become pros. But it takes a long and painful process, where only a few players in the guild can support them to Story of Sage and hhn. It also increases the difference between us and elite guild.
 - 2nd outcome (possible): too many players quit the game because they feel that staying in this community is pointless or for other reasons.
 - 3rd outcome (high success rate): actively recruiting high-level players. Due to the low number of no-guild high-level wild players around, combining two guilds to form a stronger community is the best and most efficient method I can perceive. It speeds up the process to reach **a balance between active players and casual players** and **stability for the guild**, resulting in higher significant communal development much more than individual contribution. 

### What we need?
 - Need large crowds of guild members.
 - have an elite group to represent the guild or be the face of the guild to captivate more stronger players.
   - To recognize a guild, crowds tend to look for outstanding players in the guild. For instance, a few of the players in Bliss guild was dominating themed party last Sunday, which becomes advisement for recruiting more strong players to their guild.
 - Need to reach level 3 guild as quick as possible. Since this is difficult to achieve, it becomes a standard to differentiate between startup guild and developed guild.
