## SharpShooter
- These are some interesting facts about SS that I don't have the motivation to make that video.
  1. Target limit: (adl) falcon can hit at most 10 mobs in pve, Sharpshooter can hit at most 10 mobs in pve, Sharpshooter can hit at most 5 targets in PVP.
  2. Armor: if SS, for armor, go for MM, with sp be at least 3000, it will have more dmg than the white wing set.
  3. Global Cooldown & Cast time: Credits go to Rarile (ghosting server) for this one, animation time for SS is ~0.92s (shoot + reset back) for each SS cycle. Note: this is animation time, so you can at most have ~5% global cooldown, more gcd won't matter. This is the reason you cannot move during the cooldown of SS, while you still can move when the magnum breaks (gcd: 2 sec). Here is the streamable video: https://streamable.com/pryr43. (one is without any gcd gear, and the other is).
  4. How to increase dmg against: For neutral mobs, instead of silver arrows, there are a couple of options to increase your SS atk. 1). equip magnum break card in acc card slots and use fire arrows, +20% for 18 sec (2 sec cooldown). 2). 3* sweet cookie cards in acc and use holy arrows (make sure you have enough crit). There are many headgear, mouth, face, etc that also have increased holy skill dmg. use that as your advantage. good for mixed mobs, like in endless tower.
  5. Crit: since SS has +20 crit automatically, so need 130 crit for atroce and 150 for kraken. 
  6. Trap: with new stone imprint, you have homing traps, pretty useless to be honest. One thing is doable you can detect hiding enemies at a farther distance since fire, earth, wind traps will move toward them even in hiding.
  7. Distance: SS is the farthest distance ranged atk, it has 2-3 more atk range than aspd archer. 
  8. Stats: max dex, and alter luk according to your crit, add int for max sp, and add vit if you want.
  9. Difference between atk and dmg: dmg is what you hit on the mobs, atk is what you shoot from your bow. Why does that matter? OB card/OB illusion card only doubles one of your dmg if you are hitting 10 mobs at the same time. Hunter fly has a 50% (5% * 10 mobs) chance of healing yourself when hitting 10 mobs. Some headgear effect: your atk has 3% increase 5% atk meaning 3% of your all 1 s SS, so increase one in every 33 shots on average.
