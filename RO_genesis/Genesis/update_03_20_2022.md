# Weekly Conclusion:
(03/14/2022 - 03/20/2022)
### Genesis Guild Member
 - Left 4 guild members, 
 - Joined at least 10 members (I recruited 5 Members). 
 - I estimate that around 46 guild members are inactive this week (you can see reference in my previous google sheet). 
 - Ratio of Active and Inactive is about 3:4. (less than half the guild is inactive)
### Guild Fund
 - Current Progress to lvl 3 Guild: 62,480,000/94,590,000. 
 - This week Guild Fund: 8,540,000. 
 - Average Daily Guild Fund (this week): 1,220,000. 
 - Estimated Date to lvl 3 by this rate: April. 16th.

### Personal Notes
 - However, data from these two days (Saturday and Sunday) - Daily Guild Fund is above 1,500,000.
 - Reason: more active players have joined to the guild, actively participating to time-space events.
 - Newer or more reliable data analysis: expected daily guild fund being 1,550,000 Â± 150,000 in the future. Estimated Date to lvl 3 by this rate: 19 - 23 days. (April. 9th - April. 13th.)
