# Updated Weekly Conclusion:
(03/21/2022 - 03/28/2022)
### Genesis Guild Member
 - Left/Booted: 17 Members
 - Joined: 39 Members
 - Ratio of Active and Inactive: Since too many members joined Genesis guild, I can't give an accurate estimation. Personally, I would say more than 50% members are active.
## Updated Guild Fund
 - Current Progress to lvl 3 Guild: 59,750,000/94,590,000. 
 - This week Guild Fund: 12,830,000.
 - Average Daily Guild Fund (this week): 1,832,000.
 - Estimated Daily Guild Fund (next week) : 1,800,000 Â± 200,000.
 - Estimated Date to lvl 3 guild: before Apr. 16th. (reference to linear regression model coding)

### Personal Notes
 - Currently, We are not prepared to join the war of emperium or to compete with other guilds due to large proportion of new players/potentially inactive players.
 - To further recruit strong and active players, I propose step 2 guild building strategy (self-made XD).
