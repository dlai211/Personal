### Personal Notes
 - I performed step 2 for Genesis guild this week, whereas I underestimated how unresponsive RO players could be. I could NOT get any guilds to merge with Genesis.
 - Overall, I considered it as a win for the guild, despite no strong players was joining the Genesis. We now have more information about most guilds that are in the honor guild ranking.
