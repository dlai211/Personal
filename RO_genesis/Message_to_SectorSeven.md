Message from dlai from Genesis Guild

Hi! SectorSeven,

Genesis does data collection and analysis for RO-related materials. For more significant mutual benefit, we allow our data to be accessible for every SectorSeven member in the trade of promises to assist new players in RO.

Data includes but is not limited to: 
 - Auction Price Record (since 6/24/2022)
 - Cards Awakening Attribute 
 - Trapper Guide (from my experience)
 - Elements 
 - All hidden poring locations (available by following Monday)
 - Labyrinth Floor 1 teleportation guide (available by following Monday)

In the future,  we will develop a detailed MVP skill preview, accurate calculation of ASPD, CRI, other attributes, etcetera.

The Github page is https://github.com/dlai211/Personal/tree/Genesis  & is also available on the SectorSeven discord channel.

Best Regards,

Genesis Guild
