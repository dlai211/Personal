# Constitution of Lander Hall 712:
##### Written by Christian Jairo Malunes Sarmiento & David Lai

## Loudness
 - The volume in the room should not exceed 75 dB in normal circumstances. One has the responsibility to notify the other when he would take/receive a phone/zoom call. The alarm clock's loudness should equal or below 25 % of the phone volume, and the time settings from both alarm clocks should be within one hour in normal circumstances. 
 - When one encounters special circumstances, it requires one room meeting/discussion to determine the final decision for this exception, and this exception only.

## Cleaning
 - The roommate agreement states that cleaning (including room and bathroom) is mandatory for both roommates to participate once a week on Monday. If one of the roommates is absent, it categories into excusable reason and inexcusable reason (the category would be determined by the roommate discussion). For excusable reasons, one should notify the other 12 hours prior that he would be absent from the campus, or one is disabled for uncontrollable conditions. Then, the punishment would be he would be doing the cleaning by himself for next week, and the cleaning would be examined by the spectator (the other roommate). For inexcusable reasons, one is capable but absent without any notification, then the punishment, in addition to the cleaning for next week, would be cleaning for the week after. The cleaning job would also be examined by the other roommate.
 - The cleaning inspector: Christian Jario

## Sleep Schedules 
 - The main light should be off by 11:30 pm, and any activities that occurred in the room would be in no-light condition or supported by dimmer night light. If one wishes to ask for the other roommate to wake him up, it requires the other person’s permission, and he would perform the action at the required time. 

## Property
 - Stealing => curses to hell. Paying for anything should be separated. One can temperately cover the other’s money payment, whereas it is up to the other’s responsibility to send the money he 
owned through PayPal. Money transfers would be recorded. 
 - Non-sharing list: toothbrush, earphone, used masks, personal cup/mug, soap. 

## Communication
 - If roommates have a disagreement over one or issues, two of us would schedule a time and sit together at one table, and each is given 5 minutes to illustrate his point of view. After 10 minutes, one could have the option to require more time to further discuss his perspective in order. If such one or more than one issue cannot be settled, two would require to make compromises and draft a new proposal together. 

## Guest
